# ChatBot

*A lab report by Matt Freed*


## Make the ChatBot your own

This is Zuckerbot, a seemingly harmless chatbot that attempts to get you to input your personal information. The bot was given more of a personality than the original code, with fast changing words that help show emotion and sentience. 

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot
